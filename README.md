### What's upðŸ‘‹

I'm a responsible, goal-oriented, and curious Python Developer. I have robust Python and Django knowledge and a big passion for Docker, databases, FrontEnd, and Linux. I aim to work in a team of professionals to enhance my Soft and Hard Skills. I dream of developing high-loaded systems.

Recently, I finished my Python Internship at SoftServe, where I worked in a team of 9 members using Scrum methodology. We used Django Rest Framework, React.js, and AWS to create a system for searching for the nearest beauty salons, scheduling services, notifying clients about appointments, and providing an easy and intuitive way of organizing stuff for business owners with detailed statistics. For Agile work, I decided to set up CI/CD using AWS and GitHub. My primary responsibility was to deploy our project in production. Every day we had stand-ups to enhance our communication.
