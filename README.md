My name is Yaroslav, and I am a Python Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience. I'm a responsible, goal-oriented, and curious Python Developer. I have robust Python and Django knowledge and a big passion for Docker, databases, FrontEnd, and Linux. I use GIT, Docker, Flask, Django, Scrum, and VPS services for creating websites and APIs in my daily workflow.

Before writing the code, I study your project and your needs. My goal is to help you solve the tasks you've got.

My most outstanding qualities are good communication skills, hard-worker, clarity and accuracy in work, and willingness to always achieve the desired result for the customer. I quickly learn new tools and technologies and my mind is always open.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring strong communication abilities, a collaborative mindset, and a high degree of responsibility and adaptability, making me an effective contributor to any project.

I expect to study new technologies and best practices, deliver valuable results and be a part of a great team with shared interests and values. I'm open-minded and active, always ready to learn something new.
